# HSIYA
Web app for recommending card singles from local card shops based on your commander. 

## Backend Overview (FastAPI)

The backend is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, providing a RESTful API for managing and querying trading card data. The backend interacts with a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve card information and supports search and retrieval endpoints for the frontend.

## Frontend (Next.js Dashboard)

The frontend is built with Next.js 13 using the App Router. It provides the user interface for searching, viewing, and interacting with cards from the backend API.
